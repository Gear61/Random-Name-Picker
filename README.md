The Code Doesn't Compile?
=======
If you run this code, you will get a compilation error telling you that the PremiumBackDoor class doesn't exist. The purpose of this class is to create a password that developers (and friends of the developers) can enter in to get Random Name Picker Premium for free. Simply create your own PremiumBackDoor.java with a public constant variable named "PASSWORD". You can set it to whatever you wish. When you type that string into the name list creator, you will get Random Name Picker Premium.
