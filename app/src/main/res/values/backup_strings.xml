        In order for Random Name Picker to start backing up your app data,
        you need to give it the ability to write to your device\'s external file system.
        Would you like to do that now?
    </string>
    <string name="backup_explanation">
        This app backs up all of your name lists as .txt files whenever it closes.
        These files are in the \"RandomNamePicker\" directory on your device
        and are formatted with the new-line separated format this app uses to import name lists.
        From here, you can manually trigger a backup or export all of your data as a .zip file.
