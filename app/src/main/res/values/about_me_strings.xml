    <string name="about_me_summary">Hey there, I\'m Alex!
        I build Android apps in my spare time, because it\'s super fun and I love the Android community.
        That is why this app and all others I build are free and ad-free.
        If you have any ideas on how to make this app better, please send them my way!
        Anyways, I hope this app has been of use to you and has given you a bug-free experience.
        Cheers.</string>
